# BJJ Strength Training Website
This is a project i built using Javascript and Bootstrap. The project is a strength training website for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu practitioners.

The website will provide workout plans for purchase including upper body, lower body and full body workouts. 

The need for strength training for BJJ athletes is immensely important to avoid injury and increase longevity in the game.

# Why this site?

There seemed to be a gap in leading knowledge when it comes to specific strength training for BJJ. I wanted to build a resource that BJJ athletes could utilize to improve their game and reduce injury-risk.
